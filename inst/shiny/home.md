## Thanks for using our package!

`ProfRate` is a R package that allows you to retrieve and visualize the data on [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) with an online Shiny app.
From `Ratings` tab on the navigation panel,
you can analyze the ratings data.

- You can have an idea of what words are most frequently used in comments.
- You can choose to see: positive words from comments,
negative words from comments,
or tags from the website.
- You can choose only to see comments after a specific year.

This application is driven by [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and you may find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/m-fili/ProfRate). We also have [the website for `ProfRate`](https://m-fili.github.io/ProfRate/).
