In the README file, you learned HOW to use the package.
Here, we get into the details of this package and its applications.


# Introduction
As a student, you might be interested to know more about a specific professor,
like the overall teaching quality, the difficulty of courses taught, and the characteristics.
Luckily, the website [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) gathers all this information, and we will use them to assist the user get to know their professors better.

This package mainly offers a user-friendly Shiny dashboard to visualize students' feedback on a specific professor of interest.
Users can also follow the examples and apply these powerful functions as helpers for other purposes.


# What is this package for?    
This package addresses the following areas:

* What are the positive and negative comments on a professor?
* What are the most frequent words used?
* How is the overall teaching quality?
* How difficult are the courses taught by a professor?
* How the performance of a professor has changed over time?
* How do the grades of students affect the rating of a professor?
  

# Who can use this package?
* Students: 
  * They can get more familiar with a professor.
  * Find how other students experience a course.
* Professors:
  * Self-evaluation purpose. Get to know their strengths and weaknesses from constructive feedback.
  * Track their progress and improvement over time.
  * See how the course is perceived from students' point of view.



# Functions

First, we have the flowchart of our functions, and you can see how they work with each other as shown in the figure below:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Functions.jpg')
```

There are ten functions in this package.
The first three in green generate the URL to start the whole scraping procedure.
Those in blue are the body of the package responsible for summarization and visualization.
The last one in yellow is used to launch the Shiny dashboard.

In short, firstly, a URL is generated using the professor's name, department, and university name.
Then the comments and ratings are scraped, summarized, and plotted.
All the outputs are then visualized in the Shiny dashboard.

All functions that scrape below use `polite` package, and we do try our very best to be ethical scrapers.
Let us know if there are any issues with using the website data, and we will modify it accordingly.


## `get_all_schools`

* This function generates a URL given the name of an university.
* It can be used independently, but it is used as a helper function to filter and find the professor of interest in `get_tid` function.
* For future development, it can be used for campus evaluation as well.

Examples:

```{r setup}
library(ProfRate)
```

```{r}
get_all_schools('Iowa State University')
get_all_schools('MIT')
```



## `general_info`

* This function generates the general information for a professor.
* It takes a URL and extracts the professor's name, department, and university.
* It can be used independently, but it is used as a helper function to filter and find the professor of interest in `get_tid` function.

Examples:

```{r}
general_info("https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=342455")
general_info("https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=744853")
```


## `get_tid`

* This function generates the URL given the information of the professor.
* The name argument should be the full name and is required. The university argument is also required, but the department argument is optional.
* The function uses `rvest::html_text` to check nodes and regular expression to extract ids.


```{r}
get_tid(name = 'Brakor', university = 'California Berkeley')
get_tid(name = 'Brakor', department = 'Biology', university = 'Berkeley')
```



## `get_url`

* This function takes the same argument as `get_tid`.
It assesses the tid(s) first and then generate the corresponding url(s).
* With this function, we can absolutely use name, department, and university as direct inputs for further functions, but to restrict the number of scraping to the minimum, we would only scrape once and then use URL as input for the future.

Examples:


```{r}
get_url(name = 'Brakor', department = 'Biology', university = 'Berkeley')
```



## `comment_info`

* This function extracts the comments for a given URL.
* It separates the comments according to the year and course
* It also extracts the number of thumbs up and down for each comment.
* This function can filter the comments shown for those after a specific year.



```{r}
comment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1031282", y = 2000)
comment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1129448", y = 2000)
```




## `sentiment_info`

* This function does sentiment analysis on the comments.
* It generates the set of _positive_, _negative_, and _tags_ words for a professor.
* It can filter from a certain year up to the present.

Example:

```{r}
sentiment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=69792", y = 2009, word = 'Positive')
sentiment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=69792", y = 2000, word = 'Negative')
sentiment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=69792", y = 2009, word = 'Tags')
```



## sentiment_plot

* This function visualizes the comments using a word cloud.
* It can generate plots corresponding to _positive_, _negative_, and _tags_ words, respectively.
* It can filter from a certain year up to the present.

Examples:

```{r}
sentiment_plot(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=69792", y = 2009, word = 'Positive')
```




## `ratings_info`

* Given the URL, it generates the rating info
* It creates three outputs:
  * number of comments,
  * table including the year, course, quality, difficulty, and overall rating with some other info regarding the course or studen.
  

Examples:

```{r}
ratings_info("https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1129448", y=2009)
```



## `ratings_plot`

* Given the URL, it generates the visualization for the ratings.
* It creates four subplots:
  * Overall Rating
  * Average rating by course
  * Average rating by grade
  * Average rating by year
  
  
```{r}
ratings_plot("https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1129448", y=2009)
```

## `runExample`

* The function is used to launch the Shiny dashboard.


# Testing
We included different tests for each function to make sure they were working properly.
The coverage of the package is 98%.
The only function that is not tested is `runExample`, which is used to launch the Shiny dashboard.
Here is the set of things we checked for each function in general:

* Checking the data type
* Verifying the length of inputs and outputs
* Correct format of the URL
* Correct set of arguments
* Error messages
* Checking plot reproducibility



# Documentation
Each function is documented thoroughly. The set of information included in each function is as below:

* Name and description
* Usage
* Arguments and their definition
* Outputs and their definition
* Examples



# Website
The [website](https://m-fili.github.io/ProfRate/) is launched and includes references, examples, and other useful information like this vignette on how to use this package.




# Shiny dashboard
As introduced before, `runExample` would launch our well-designed Shiny dashboard.
The dashboard is highly comprehensive and user-friendly.
Most importantly, it utilizes and shows all the functionalities discussed so far in an interactive way.
We include some screenshots of the Shiny dashboard as below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('ShinyHome.png')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('ShinyWordcloud.png')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('ShinyRatings.png')
```

# Future Steps

Here are the future steps to make this package more comprehensive.

1. Adding campus evaluation to the analysis as well as the Shiny dashboard.

2. Incorporating correlation analysis and outlier detection:
  * Relation between the ratings and grades
  * Relation between the comments and grades

3. Incorporate likes and dislikes into the analysis to emphasize the value of comments.
