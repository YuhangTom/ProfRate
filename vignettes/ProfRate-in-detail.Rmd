In the README file, you learned HOW to use the package.
Here, we get into the details of this package and its applications.


## Introduction
As a student, you might be interested to know more about a specific professor,
like the overall teaching quality, the difficulty of courses taught, and the characteristics.
Luckily, the website [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) gathers all this information, and we will use them to assist the user get to know their professors better.

This package mainly offers a user-friendly Shiny dashboard to visualize students' feedback on a specific professor of interest.
Users can also follow the examples and apply these powerful functions as helpers for other purposes.


## What is this package for?    
This package addresses the following areas:

* What are the positive and negative comments on a professor?
* What are the most frequent words used?
* How is the overall teaching quality?
* How difficult are the courses taught by a professor?
* How the performance of a professor has changed over time?
* How do the grades of students affect the rating of a professor?
  

## Who can use this package?
* Students: 
  * They can get more familiar with a professor.
  * Find how other students experience a course.
* Professors:
  * Self-evaluation purpose. Get to know their strengths and weaknesses from constructive feedback.
  * Track their progress and improvement over time.
  * See how the course is perceived from students' point of view.



## Functions

First, we have the flowchart of our functions, and you can see how they work with each other as shown in the figure below:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Functions.jpg')
```

There are ten functions in this package.
The first three in green generate the URL to start the whole scraping procedure.
Those in blue are the body of the package responsible for summarization and visualization.
The last one in yellow is used to launch the Shiny dashboard.

In short, firstly, a URL is generated using the professor's name, department, and university name.
Then the comments and ratings are scraped, summarized, and plotted.
All the outputs are then visualized in the Shiny dashboard.



### `get_all_schools`

* This functions generates a URL, given the name of an university.
* It can be used independently, but it is used as a helper function to filter and find the professor of interest in `get_tid` function.
* For the future development it can be used for Campus Evaluation as well.

Examples:

```{r setup}
library(ProfRate)
```

```{r}
get_all_schools('Iowa State University')
```


```{r}
get_all_schools('MIT')
```



### `general_info`

* This function generates the general information for an professor.
* It takes a URL and extract the professor's name, department and university.
* It can be used independently, but it is used as a helper function to filter and find the professor of interest in `get_tid` function.

Examples:

```{r}
general_info("https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=342455")
```

```{r}
general_info("https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=744853")
```


### `get_tid`

* This functions generates the URL given the information of the professor.
* The name argument should be full name and is required, the university argument is also required, but department argument is optional.

* Or, we can give the name and university:

```{r}
get_tid(name = 'Brakor', university = 'California Berkeley')
```

* We can also restrict the searches by specifying all infromation:

```{r}
get_tid(name = 'Brakor', department = 'Biology', university = 'Berkeley')
```



### `get_url`

* This function takes the same argument as `get_tid`, but generates the final URL. Under the hood it uses `get_tid` to first extract the `tid` number and then it generates the URL.

Examples:


```{r}
get_url(name = 'Brakor', department = 'Biology', university = 'Berkeley')
```



### `comment_info`

* This function extracts the comments for a given URL.
* It separates the comments according to the year and course
* It also extracts the number of thumbs up and down for each comment.
* This function can filter the comments to be shown for those after a specific year.



```{r}
comment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1031282", y = 2000)
```

```{r}
comment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1129448", y = 2000)
```




### `sentiment_info`

* This function do sentiment analysis on the comments.
* It generates the set of _positive_, _negative_, and _tags_ for an professor.
* It can filter the year ti include certain from a certain year up to present.

Example:

```{r}
sentiment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=69792", y = 2009, word = 'Positive')
```

```{r}
sentiment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=69792", y = 2000, word = 'Negative')
```



```{r}
sentiment_info(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=69792", y = 2009, word = 'Tags')
```



### sentiment_plot

* This functions visualizes the comments using word cloud.
* It can generate the _positive_, _negative_, and _tags_.
* It can filter the years to show the words in comments after a scpecific year.

Examples:

```{r}
sentiment_plot(url = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=69792", y = 2009, word = 'Positive')
```




### `ratings_info`

* given the URL, it generate the rating info
* It creates three outputs:
  * number of comments
  * ratings table including the year, course, quality, difficulty, overall rating with some other info regarding the course or student who left that rating.
  * summary of ratings
  

Examples:

```{r}
ratings_info("https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1129448", y=2009)
```



### `ratings_plot`

* given the URL, it generate the visualization for the ratings
* It creates four subplots:
  * Overall Rating
  * Average rating by course
  * Average rating by grade
  * Average rating by year
  
  
  
```{r}
ratings_plot("https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1129448", y=2009)
```


## Testing
We included different tests for each function to make sure it is working properly. The coverage of the package is 98%, as the time of writing this report. Here are the set of things in general that is checked for each function:

* Checking the Data Type
* Verifying the Length of Inputs and Outputs
* Correct Format of the URL
* Correct set of Arguments
* Error Messages
* Checking plot producibility



## Documentation
Each function is documented thoroughly. The set of information included in each function is as below:

* Name and description
* Usage
* Arguments and their definition
* Outputs and their definition
* Examples



## Website
The [website](https://m-fili.github.io/ProfRate/) is launched and includes the references and other useful information on how to use this package.




## ShinyApp
In this package, there is a function named `runExample` that the user can utilize to show all the functionalities discussed so far through an interactive App.





## Future Steps

Here are the future steps to make this package more comprehensive.

1. Adding Campus Evaluation to the App

2. Incorporating correlation Analysis & outlier detection
  * Relation between the ratings and grades
  * Relation between the comments and grades

3. Incorporate likes and dislikes into analysis to emphasize on the valid comments.
